# Resurate
Resurate is Machine Learning based APP

## Problem Statement
Traditional resume screening processes suffer from inefficiency and human bias, often involving time-consuming manual reviews that may inaccurately match candidates with job requirements. This inefficiency can impede swift talent acquisition and result in missing out on ideal candidates. Today, we introduce an AI/ML algorithm that revolutionizes this process by parsing, filtering, and ranking resumes based on candidate suitability, significantly streamlining selection, accelerating hiring, and driving efficiency while remaining adaptable to future recruitment needs.

## Proposed Approach
We leverage AI/ML to revolutionize resume screening, aiming for faster, unbiased, and precise candidate-job matching. Our approach includes data collection, NLP-based feature extraction, model training, resume parsing, and a user-friendly interface for seamless deployment.

## Features
**Automated Resume Parsing**: NLP-powered parsing extracts essential candidate information from resumes.

**Bias Mitigation**: Eliminates human bias, ensuring fair and objective evaluations.

**Customizable Ranking**: Quantifies candidate relevance based on job description, streamlining selection.
